                    <p>Quality is a word synonymous with Hari Bhari that takes pride in our stringent quality standards. We go to great lengths and take the utmost care and precaution to ensure that each day our customers get nothing but the very best across all our products, services & interactions. Here are a few quality standards that we practice at Hari Bhari.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Only A+ Quality Levels</h2>
                    <p>When you get into a Hari Bhari online store you can be sure that you will get the best quality level of fresh produce and spice products in your region. Our teams take great pains to locate and source only the finest available produce in every fruit and vegetable. Our spice products too are chosen especially as per our stringiest standards.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Everyday Freshness</h2>
                    <p>All fresh produce at our portals are procured on a daily basis by our vendors. These are delivered every morning to the warehouse or vendor's stock. Stale and old produce of the previous days is discarded or sent back to be resold through other channels. This ensures that Hari Bhari consumers always get to choose from a wide variety of the freshest produce & best spice products.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Appropriate Care in Storage</h2>
                    <p>We store our products as per recommended conditions and ideal temperatures. We do not switch off our Freezers, Chillers or other refrigeration equipment at night. This is to ensure that temperature sensitive products are stored at correct temperatures all through. We switch on exhaust fans at night to ensure air circulation for ambient products. Even though our running costs are higher, we believe that this is a small price to pay to ensure 100% fit for consumption products at all times.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Only High Quality Vendors</h2>
                    <p>We only deal with suppliers and vendors who trade ethically. We do not deal with the grey market or with vendors who have a reputation to deal in products by abusing and altering sell by dates. In the unlikely event that any of our suppliers is caught tampering with sell by dates, we penalize them appropriately and their supply contracts to our stores are terminated.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Exhaustive Stock Checks</h2>
                    <p>We thoroughly check all our branded products for expiry dates each month and segregate those products that are close to expiry. These products are either sent back to vendors or discarded completely. Products that are sent back to vendors are usually re-sold through other channels by independent retail stores.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Expert Care(Management)</h2>
                    <p>All our field representatives compulsorily wear hand gloves and hair net while handling food. The warehouse and all fixtures are sanitized at regular intervals. Food storage and display areas are cleaned with food grade cleaners as per prefixed schedules.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Return Policy</h2>
                    <p>In the unlikely event that the products purchased from us are expired or spoiled when purchased, we would be happy to replace or exchange the foods so purchased or refund the money to the customer.</p>
